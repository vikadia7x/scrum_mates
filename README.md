**NOTE:**
**We received a mail from Azure with the below text. So, we have deleted all the api keys and passwords from all our branches. We would be using AzureKeyVault in the coming sprint. The current master branch is unstable. Although we have deployed our we app which is stable and will share the url with the deliverable**

**"Your SendGrid account has been temporarily suspended as we have detected that your account's credentials (password and/or API key) are publicly listed on the code repository GitHub. This is a dangerous practice which may result in your account being used by unauthorized third parties to send malicious content and which may incur damage to your reputation as a quality sender and charges against your account for high usage that you did not perform."**

**We are using a new send grid account but we have not committed the code with new account in master.**
